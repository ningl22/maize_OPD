This repository hosts the main code for generating the RF model and figures for "Can Chinese maize be self-sufficient in climate change with the existing area and favorable environments in the 2030s? Evidences from data-driven projection and field trials".

R version 4.2.0 (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) was used to aggregate and analyze the modeling results.

Some packages are necessary being loaded prior to running it (e.g., randomForest, dplyr, tidyverse, hydroGOF, rio, easynls). 

All of the code and raw data (RF model) to produce the numerical values reported in the analysis are available in these files. 

This is research code and may require more detailed assistance to be fully functional. We can provide technical help if readers are interested.
